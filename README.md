# stroke_rehab_app (Flutter version)

This is my Flutter App assignment for KIT305 assignment-4. I got 100% which is a HD for this assignment. I have not make the app compatible for all phone screens (yet!) as it was not a requirement for the assignment and it works for Android only. I need to write the iOS code for the app to run on iOS.

Some notes for testing my app:

1) The app was designed in the Pixel 4a API30 simulator.

2) The orientation is vertical.

3) Please use API30 simulator because the camera doesn't work above API30.

4) You need to swipe left or right an item to delete an item in the History table.

5) You need to press the "Enter" button on the keyboard to save your name.

6) It takes a bit of time to display the picture on both the game complete page and the detailed history page so wait a little bit.

7)  dtFormatter.dateFormat = "ss.SSS"

shows the milliseconds with seconds. This allows the user to see how many milliseconds it took him to press each button. I didn't include hour and minute because the user can see from the start and end time so it would be redundant information.
